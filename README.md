# The Galsat Engineered Language

Thanks very much for your interest in *Galsat*, an engineered language. This repo is intended as an editable and frequently updatable companion to the book **The Galsat Engineered Language**, currently in development.\
Unlike **The Galsat Engineered Language** in book form, the website will be updated for any and all minor changes to the language. As such, the website is expected to be up-to-date at all times, so should be the first point of reference for users.\
